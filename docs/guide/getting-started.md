# Getting Started

## Introduction

Pinia Generic provides helper functions and types to create generic stores, and/or split up your store into multiple files.

Generic stores aren't of much use on their own, but they can be extended to create regular stores that inherit their state, getters and actions. Generic stores are centered around generic types, which can be the whole state, or a property of the state.
