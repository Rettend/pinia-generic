    details: Create generic stores that can be reused, massively reducing duplicate code in large projects
  - title: 📁 Split stores
    details: Split stores into multiple files, so relevant code can be grouped together
  - title: 📦 Small size
    details: It's mostly just types, so using the package is more lines of code than the package itself 😅
